## Title - Multitask(More likely Online Shop)
(my php version is 8.0 && I wrote this in Laravel 9)
After database setup,
## You need to run 'php artisan migrate:fresh --seed' && 'php artisan db:seed --class=GeneralSeeder'

##This is the backend of the multi-task-app-client. We need to run this admin backend.
